## Project Description

This is my personal main portfolio website, where I showcase my latest projects.

## Technologies Used

This website is built with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**, a React framework that enables fast and scalable web applications. For the styling, I chose **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, which allows me to build custom designs without leaving my HTML. To manage serverless data storage, I’m using **[Upstash](https://upstash.com/)**, ensuring that the site remains fast and efficient. Lastly, I’ve integrated **[Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/)**, which helps me seamlessly manage content across the site.

Deployed on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**, this setup ensures that the site is not only quick to load but also easy to maintain and scale as needed.
